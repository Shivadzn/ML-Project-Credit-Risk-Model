📘 Project Overview
Credit risk assessment is crucial for evaluating a customer’s loan default probability. This Credit Risk Prediction Model leverages supervised machine learning techniques to predict risk levels based on financial and demographic data, enabling financial institutions to make informed credit decisions.

Key Objectives:

📈 Predict default probability based on comprehensive customer data.
🔍 Analyze feature significance to understand influential factors in credit default.
💻 Provide a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction with the model.
Process Flow:

The chart outlines the project’s pipeline:

Data Collection: Gathering customer demographic and financial information.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data.
Model Training: Applying machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance with metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, and F1 Score.
Deployment: Creating an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
✨ Features
Predictive Modeling: Uses machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans data, handles missing values, and encodes categorical variables for optimal performance.
Model Interpretability: Integrated feature importance tools for explainable AI.
Web Application: Built with Streamlit, offering an interactive UI to input data and get predictions.
💻 Technologies Used

⚙️ Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-risk-model.git
Navigate to the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd credit-risk-model
Install dependencies:
bash

Use the Web App: Upload data or manually input customer details.
View Predictions: The model predicts the probability of credit default in real time.
📊 Results and Analysis
Feature Importance Analysis: Visualize feature significance to understand which customer attributes have the most influence on the likelihood of default.


Insight: The chart shows that Income, Credit History, and Debt-to-Income Ratio are key factors affecting credit default likelihood.

Confusion Matrix: Display the confusion matrix to observe how well the model distinguishes between defaulters and non-defaulters.


Insight: The confusion matrix shows high accuracy with minimal false positives and false negatives, indicating reliable predictions.

ROC Curve: The ROC Curve offers a visual assessment of the model’s performance in separating classes.


Insight: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) demonstrates the model’s capability to differentiate between defaulters and non-defaulters.

🚧 Challenges
Class Imbalance: Addressed with SMOTE and undersampling.
Feature Engineering: Identified critical features to improve predictive accuracy.
Model Interpretability: Balancing accuracy with actionable insights for stakeholders.
🔮 Future Enhancements
🧠 Advanced Algorithms: Experiment with XGBoost and CatBoost for further accuracy.
☁️ Cloud Deployment: Host the application on a cloud platform for broader accessibility.
📊 Dashboard: Implement analytics to monitor prediction history and key metrics.
